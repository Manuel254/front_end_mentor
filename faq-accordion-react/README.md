### Useful resources

## Acknowledgments

I would like to acknowledge **_@coding addict_** who helped me know most of the things in react and when I felt like I was a bit stuck I checked on his tutorials and had some insight.
**_@WebDevSimplified_** also assisted me in some of his tutorials mostly in react hooks.
